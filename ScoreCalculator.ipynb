Or when you are done editing, press **ctrl+enter**, or **ctrl+F9**. You'll probably get a warning about trusting the source of the code, and to reset runtimes, and such. \n","\n","This code won't touch anything locally, or anything else for that matter, besides some simple calculations. So, if you trust that this code won't do anything besides what I've described in the original article, and in addition at the bottom of this notebook, then press yes to all of the prompts raised when you run this notebook.\n","\n","So plug in the numbers, press play, and share your score with your friends. Can you beat your own score, or that of those you know? Numbers are adjusted by the BigMac index, because why not.\n","\n","Note1: none of your data will be stored anywhere and the values you put in here cannot be seen by anyone.\n","\n","Note2: this is semi scientific.
