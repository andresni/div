Do you beat your national average?**\n","\n","**To calculate**, simply edit the entries below according to instructions, then press the little play button at the left of the block. Or when you are done editing, press **ctrl+enter**, or **ctrl+F9**. At the bottom will be your score, and **the higher the better**. Give yourself a big pat on the back if you score above zero!\n","\n","You'll probably get a warning about trusting the source of the code, and to reset runtimes, and such. \n","\n","This code won't touch anything locally, or anything else for that matter, besides some simple calculations. So, if you trust that this code won't do anything besides what I've described in the original article, and in addition at the bottom of this notebook, then press yes to all of the prompts raised when you run this notebook.\n","\n","**So plug in the numbers, press play, and share your score with your friends. Can you beat your own score, or that of those you know? **\n","\n","Note1: Numbers are adjusted by the BigMac index, because why not. In effect, the more money you earn, the harder the negatives hit, and the less the positives contribute. Because it's easier for rich people to be green, and less excuse to not be green.\n","\n","Note2: None of your data will be stored anywhere and the values you put in here cannot be seen by anyone.\n","\n","Note3: This is semi scientific. Take it for what it is. The plugged numbers are somewhat roughly representative.
